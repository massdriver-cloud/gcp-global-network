# Operator Guide for gcp-global-network

Google Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) creates a private cloud as an abstraction on Google Cloud's physical infrastructure. VPC provides secure network isolation across regions along with the ability to adjust the IP space on the fly.

## Use Cases
### General Compute
VPC is vital to running almost anything on Google Cloud.

## Configuration Presets
### Private
This is our only guided configuration for the global network. It sets Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks for Private Service Connect and Private services access. 

## Design
The gcp-global-network bundle creates a VPC. It is the global parent for everything that needs network access. You will end up connecting bundles to gcp-subnetwork most of the time, with that subnetwork connected to the global network (cluster → subnetwork → global-network). You cannot run anything in a VPC without a subnetwork. The subnetwork defines the IP range. 
### Private Service Connect
Private Service Connect improves security by allowing you to access GCP APIs across VPCs without traversing the public Internet.
### Private Services Access
Private services access allows GCP services (such as CloudSQL and Memorystore) to be offered through a single peering connection with an internal IP address so that each instance does not consume its own peering connection. This is important since GCP global networks have a peering limit of only 25 connections.
You may choose the CIDR blocks for Private Service Connect and private services access, but we do not allow you to turn them off.

## Best Practices

## Security 
Massdriver allocates a range for private services access so that you can launch private Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services without individual peering connections. See documentation here for more information.
### Private Service Connect
Private Service Connect lowers network egress costs and latency. You also benefit from the improved security of private networking.
### Private Services Access
The peering limit of 25 often becomes a major issue for companies because it limits service scaling. Because private services access routes GCP services through a single peering connection, you can scale larger without hitting the peering limit.

## Trade-offs
VPC Flow Logs are not turned on or configurable by this bundle. Even on medium-sized networks, they incur a large cost.
